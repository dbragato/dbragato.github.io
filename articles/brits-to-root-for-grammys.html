          <a href="https://www.grammy.com/awards/67th-annual-grammy-awards-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nominations</a> were released last week for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, which are scheduled to take place on February 2, 2025.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The US-based award ceremony typically features a majority of American artists, but Brits also often clean up okay, and this year is shaping up to be no exception. British nominees this year include Raye, Charli XCX, Jacob Collier, and the Beatles.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Raye, 27, who grew up in Tooting and Croydon, shared an emotional video on Instagram of herself 
          <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14063259/Raye-tears-Grammy-nominations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving the news</a> of her three nominations.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Raye is in the running for both Best New Artist and for Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical. She was also nominated as an engineer for Lucky Daye’s Algorithm, which is up for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.
        </p>

          32-year-old Charli XCX’s Brat – which topped charts around the world and inspired 
          <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/brat-summer-charli-xcx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“brat summer”</a> – was unsurprisingly nominated for both Best Dance/Electronic Album and Album of the Year. Brat is heavily inspired by the English Y2K rave era that the Cambridge-born, Essex-raised singer grew up in.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Charli XCX also received nominations for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGd4efgdPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Guess”</a> with Billie Eilish), Record of the Year (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJW-VvmRKsE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“360”</a>), Best Music Video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJW-VvmRKsE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“360”</a>), Best Dance Pop Recording (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwZ1L_0QLjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Von Dutch"</a>), and Best Pop Solo Performance ("Apple").
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Jacob Collier of north London, a Grammy favourite who has competed against much more commercially successful artists several years in a row, received an Album of the Year nomination for Djesse Vol. 4.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Collier was also nominated for Best Global Music Performance for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaLqkeKx814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Rock Somewhere”</a> (featuring Anoushka Shankar & Varijashree Venugopal), and Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxsfV3vGweQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Bridge over Troubled Water"</a> (with John Legend and Tori Kelly).
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The surviving Beatles received a Record of the Year nomination for the AI-assisted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opxhh9Oh3rg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Now and Then”</a>, which was built off of a demo John Lennon recorded in 1979.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison attempted to record the track in 1995, but never released it due to sound quality issues.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          It was only in 2023 that McCartney and Starr finally released the song, after new AI technology made it possible to efficiently extract Lennon’s voice from the demo tape.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The Grammys recently updated their rules to clarify that, while “only human creators are eligible”, music featuring “elements of A.I. material” is eligible as long as the human component is “meaningful”. The song “Now and Then” was determined to meet these criteria, but its nomination still raised some controversy.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Final voting will open next month on December 12, 2024 and close three weeks later on January 3, 2025.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The award ceremony itself will take place in Los Angeles in just over two months, and will be streamed live via CBS, Paramount+, YouTube, and AP, as well as the official Grammy Awards website.
