          As tomorrow’s inauguration approaches, D.C. locals are uneasy. Juliet Remi, who works as a paralegal in downtown D.C., describes the feeling in the city as “sort of a sense of foreboding... a very ominous vibe.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Over the past few days, an estimated 200,000 inauguration tourists have descended on the city, which is itself home to just 700,000 residents. Aida Shipley, a resident of Columbia Heights, puts it bluntly: “There are Trumpers everywhere.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Inauguration Day is not a national holiday. However, Remi (along with millions of others across America) will not have to go in to work tomorrow, as it coincides with another important date – Martin Luther King Jr. Day. For some, including Remi and her coworkers, this has been a relief – it removes the obligation to continue with business as usual. Her employer told them that even if it were not a holiday, they would have at least been excused from coming into the office that day.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The co-occurrence is also painful for many Americans. Nidhi Dontula, a resident of Foggy Bottom, shares that she feels MLK Day has been co-opted by the inauguration, and that dissonance is weighing heavily on the city.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          D.C. has historically been a majority Black city. In recent years, the Black population has dropped slightly below the 50% mark, but it is still the largest racial group. Of Trump’s 2024 voters, only 3% were Black. He has repeatedly worked with and endorsed white supremacists. While he did see a slight increase in Black and Hispanic voters in this election, the racism within his base remains no secret.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          “The general sentiment in my social circles is just ‘Stay inside on Monday. Don't go near downtown. The Trumpies are out and about.’ It's just a general state of commiseration. You can't avoid it when you live in the city and it's exactly where it's happening. It's just such a part of our lived experience.” Dontula says. 
          It reminds Remi of how the city felt in November: “There was a similar feeling approaching Election Day when a lot of shops were boarded up and restaurants were closing for the day.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Then, like now, the fear is somewhat amorphous. What is certain is that January 6, 2021 is still relatively fresh in residents’ minds. Although the attempted coup did not ultimately result in violence against the general D.C. population, it is a reminder of the unpredictability of the polarized political landscape and the real possibility of escalation to violence. “It feels a little like doomsday prepping,” Remi says.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Today, roads are blocked off, gates have been set up around federal buildings, and the area is even more heavily policed than usual. “There's definitely a lot more D.C. police out and about, and the area just feels more secured and like… fortified.” Dontula says.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Shipley acknowledges that inaugurations are an expected part of life in the District. “It's always a zoo down by the Mall, the Capitol, because that's where the inauguration would be. That's avoidable enough.” But to her, this inauguration feels different: “The encroaching on the rest of Northwest D.C. is new. I don't know what they’re doing all the way in Petworth,” she says, referring to a neighborhood several miles north of the National Mall.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Shipley speculates that overbooking and steep prices at hotels in the area may be pushing tourists to stay in Airbnbs in neighborhoods like hers, further from the inauguration site. She also blames the decision to move the ceremony from its traditional location on the Mall to inside the Capitol building. The president-elect announced Friday that the ceremony would be held inside due to “very cold weather.” Almost a quarter of a million ticket-holders were offered seats at Capital One Arena instead, where footage of the ceremony will be broadcast live on a large screen.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The collision of the progressive city residents and the conservative Trump base is also a source of cultural tensions. Trump is regularly disparaging about the city, and his criticisms tend to have racial undertones. He has described it as a 
          <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-feud-washington-democratic-city-desantis-79cbd7c07f5b46993fcde3347eff8001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“filthy and crime ridden embarrassment to our nation”</a>, among other things. Some city residents feel that the Trump supporters feel entitled to come into their home and judge and gawk at them.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Remi describes heading to dinner to celebrate a friend’s birthday yesterday evening (on foot, due to the road closures) and walking past a group of several dozen inauguration tourists “decked out in Trump gear,” camping out near Capital One Arena. One of the campers made a derisive comment about her appearance, loud enough for her to hear. “It was something like, ‘look what that one’s wearing’ and then a gesture in my direction,” Remi says. “I felt judged because I was wearing a revealing top.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          These surface-level tensions bely a much deeper pattern. D.C. residents are overwhelmingly opposed to the incoming administration. Trump earned only 6.5% of the vote in D.C., to Kamala Harris’s 90.3%. That’s not particularly surprising – to many residents, it feels like a law of nature that D.C.’s three electoral votes will always go to the Democratic candidate in Presidential Elections.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Despite having a larger population than Wyoming or Vermont, D.C. is not a state, and does not have representation in Congress. City property, from the license plates to the trash cans, is passive aggressively emblazoned with the motto: <i>Taxation without Representation</i> – a reference to the American Revolution slogan used as a rallying cry against British rule. The District has been fighting for statehood for decades. Whereas in all other states the two main parties in local elections are the Democratic and Republican parties, in D.C. the competition is typically between the Democratic party and the Statehood-Green party.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Since it is not a state, D.C. is not protected by checks and balances. It has a certain level of local autonomy, referred to as “Home Rule”, which was hard won in the 70s. But the federal government could choose to rescind Home Rule at any time and reclaim total control of the district. This is the crux of perhaps the largest tension between Donald Trump and the people of D.C. – he has repeatedly threatened to do this.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          While he did not end Home Rule during his first term, he did exercise excessive force in the District – including by deploying federal police who used tear gas and rubber bullets to put down the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. Now, he has the congressional support he would need to take back the District if he chose to. Dontula says this possibility is concerning to her, given the discrepancy between the demographics and desires of the constituency in D.C. itself, and the federal government's agenda.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Shipley explains that, “The idea that [D.C.] can represent itself and make its own decisions is discounted because of its strong Black roots. And it's even more discounted because it's a city with the capital in it. The underlying message is, these people can't govern themselves, can’t be entrusted with governing themselves, in a place that the capital is also located – because such a high population [of D.C.] is people of color.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          For now, all they can do is hunker down and wait to see how events unfold.
