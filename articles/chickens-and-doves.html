          The last time I crossed paths with Penelope Eleni Watson, over a decade ago, we were both teenagers. Today, as she welcomes me into her trendy, sun-filled Notting Hill flat, in some ways she doesn’t seem that different than I remember – fashionable, bubbly, unabashedly feminine.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          If you weren’t paying much attention, you might read her as an airhead. But really, she just isn’t bothering with stilted professionalism, or performing false sincerity in order to be taken seriously as a young woman. As I spend more time with her, my initial impression of adolescence fades. In a way, Watson’s effervescence actually looks more like maturity – someone old enough to understand that being human is painful enough – it isn’t necessary to put on displays of suffering to prove our humanity.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Watson grew up in northern California, but has spent her entire adult life in London, where she has made her debut as a visual artist. Her work first appeared in the exhibition <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reconnectprojectuk?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reconnect</em></a> at the Fitzrovia Gallery, in the West End, in 2021.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          She also partnered with sound designer Yiannis Christidis to create a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CN9z0iMrOo-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative piece</a> for <em>Multimedia Encounters: Experimental Approaches to Ethnographic Research</em>, a 2021–2022 exhibition hosted by the Multimedia Anthropology Lab at University College London, which was featured in <a href="https://clotmag.com/news/conference-multimedia-encounters-experimental-approaches-to-ethnographic-research-by-ucl-mal-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>CLOT magazine</em></a> and <a href="https://www.matters-of-activity.de/en/activities/3411/multimedia-encounters-experimental-approaches-to-ethnographic-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Matters of Activity</em></a>. The virtual reality component of the exhibition is no longer accessible – in fact, Mozilla shut down the entire once-buzzy metaverse that had hosted it. For better or worse, art that engages new and rapidly evolving technologies must always accept impermanence.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Since <em>Multimedia Encounters</em>, Watson has returned to analog media. She works in a range of mediums, including hard ground etching, aquatint, and chiaroscuro woodcuts.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          In addition to being an artist herself, Watson is also an art world professional, having worked in high-end art consultancies and auction houses since graduating university. Having a day job means she doesn’t rely on selling her own pieces to get by – which allows her to work at her own pace and on her own terms. Her career also keeps her finger on the pulse of London’s dynamic art scene.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Over the past year, however, 26-year-old Watson has stepped away from that scene entirely, following the unexpected death of her mother early this year. “After that happened, I quit my job,” she says. “I went back to the U.S. for a few months, and I wasn't making any art at that time because I didn't have any extra bandwidth.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, she returned to the studio for the first time since that loss. Within those two weeks, she has been working on a new piece – which she has completed an etching for, but not yet made a print of. She has titled the piece <em>Mothers and Doves</em>. Rather than speaking to me from a place of reflection on a polished work, she is currently in the midst of the creative process.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The composition of <em>Mothers and Doves</em> is markedly different from anything in Watson’s oeuvre before it. Gone is the symmetry and laser-focus of her earlier work, which often portrayed a solitary subject, rooted in a single universal archetype. Instead, <em>Mothers and Doves</em> portrays multiple subjects – distinct, but in relationship with each other. “I feel like I really am at a turning point in my art, where it is coming from a more substantial place within me,” she says.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          There are three focal points within the image – a woman, a bird in the woman’s arms, and a set of three chalices. Watson’s family had chickens when she was growing up, and in her memories her mother is often holding a chicken (or a turkey, or a wounded animal Watson found outside). She describes her mother as holding many things – fearlessness, formidability, but also softness.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          <em>Mothers and Doves</em> may be inspired by her mother, but Watson also emphasizes that the female figure in the image is an idealization of womanhood, rather than a literal depiction of her mother. “It's just a representation. It's more like… more the bird.” She gestures to the bird as she’s talking: “This is her, too, for me, than necessarily the face or the figure. It’s more the act of holding.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The three chalices in the etching are modeled on three small heirloom crystal glasses Watson inherited from her grandparents, and symbolize difficult emotional inheritances. But they’re also representative of the three women of her immediate family – Watson herself, her younger sister, and of course, her mother. She has a fascination with trinities, which she thinks comes from her childhood exposure to her mother’s religion, Greek Orthodoxy. She describes the religion as a “visual language” that was all around her growing up, from the grand Byzantine-style Greek Orthodox church her family visited in Oakland, CA., to the small religious icons her mother kept around their home.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          She shows me the physical glasses; only two of the three remain. I am expecting her to draw the metaphor back to grief, but she doesn’t. “One of them got broken, which is fine, because…” she hesitates, but doesn’t waiver. “I don't know. For some reason it didn't really bother me.” Her voice is balanced and easy.
