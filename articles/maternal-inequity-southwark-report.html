          The recently vinted Southwark Maternity Commission released a sobering 
          <a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/childcare-and-parenting/advice-and-support-for-families/southwark-maternity-commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report on racial disparities in maternal outcomes</a> 
          last week, but new and expecting mothers in the borough will have to wait at least 6 more months for action from the Council.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The report was based on the Commission’s conversations with over 750 residents, including parents and maternal healthcare workers, some of whom gave harrowing personal accounts of their experiences with pregnancy and childbirth in Southwark.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          These local findings were in line with grim national statistics. For example, in the UK, Black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy or shortly afterwards than White women, according to research cited in the report.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          National data has also shown that Asian women are twice as likely to die during pregnancy or shortly afterwards than White women, and Black babies are more than twice as likely to be stillborn than White babies in the UK, the report notes.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The report concluded a 9-month investigation, in which the Commission aimed to “Assess local inequalities in the access, experience and outcomes for maternity services, specifically for those parents from ethnic minorities and/or socially disadvantaged backgrounds.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          It also evaluated Southwark’s implementation of national maternal inequality recommendations, and identified “additional areas for action and improvement.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The report concludes with ten general recommendations for systemic change, including “leadership in addressing racism that leads to unequal maternal health,” and “developing a new national way of reporting maternal health.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The next step in the initiative will be to develop an action plan, to be released in April 2025.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Councillor Evelyn Akoto launched the Commission earlier this year, appointing a panel of highly experienced maternity experts. Akoto also co-chairs the Commission, alongside public health nurse Dame Professor Donna Kinnair.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The initiative devoted an unprecedented commitment of Council time and resources to the issue, and drew praise from the community, with one resident calling it “a strong example for the UK.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          “Southwark Council deserves credit for tackling the issue,” local reporter 
          <a href="https://southwarknews.co.uk/area/southwark/comment-southwarks-action-on-maternity-inequality-sets-a-strong-example-for-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herbie Russell commented</a>, 
          “This is a great example of a local council going over and beyond what is normally expected to change the lives of its constituents.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The recommendations do not appear to be binding in any way in terms of local policy as of yet, but residents hope this will be a turning point for the borough.
